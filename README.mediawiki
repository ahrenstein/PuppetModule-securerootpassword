=== Puppet Secure Root Password Module ===
This puppet module will generate secure root passwords based on a seed string and the FQDN of the machine for easy lookup later.
=== Requirements ===
*1) php5-cli to run PHP script for the custom Facter fact (Module will install this)
*2) whois package for the mkpasswd command in order to hash the passwords properly (Module will install this)
*3) Puppet version 3.4 or later (Test on 3.7.3 only)
*4) Ubuntu 12.04 or later (Tested on 14.04 only)
=== Installation Instructions ===
*1) Check the git repo out to a module directory named "securerootpassword"
*2) Add the module to your site.pp or hiera data
*2a) Optionally you can override the password with the hiera variable securerootpassword:rootpassword encrypted as a shadow file compatible password
=== How admins can lookup passwords ===
The PHP script doing the work is using the core code based on https://github.com/ahrenstein/SecurePassGenWeb so as long as you know the seed, you can deploy that website and lookup your passwords.
=== SECURITY WARNINGS ===
*1) The seed string is stored in $MODULE_DIR/lib/facter/spg_pass.rb <br />You must change it from the default in order to protect your environment.
*2) The seed is stored in a fact since puppet masters don't push the modules to their local machines. <br />It's highly unlikely that the raw fact's definition is stored on agent machines, but it is still possible.
